# Diabetic_Prediction_Using_Python

## Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict whether an individual is likely to develop diabetes based on various health factors. The model analyzes factors such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and more to make predictions.

## Features
- Predict diabetes likelihood based on health metrics

- Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

- Visualize model accuracy and performance

- Handle missing values and preprocess data effectively

- Web-based interface (coming soon)

## Limitation
- A key limitation of this diabetes prediction model is the size of the dataset. The dataset used for training is relatively small and may not capture the full complexity of real-world data. With a limited number of samples, the model may struggle to generalize well to new, unseen data, which can affect its accuracy and performance.

In practice, larger and more diverse datasets would help improve the modelâ€™s ability to make more accurate predictions, as it would have access to a broader range of examples and patterns. Without sufficient data, the model is at risk of underfitting and may not provide the most reliable results across different populations or medical conditions.
